I am a Computer Science and AI student at IE University. I am passionate about coding, mathematics, and entrepreneurship. In my free time you will find me either learning a new skill (completing a course, reading a book), challenging myself (participating in competitions, doing competitive programming, building a new project), or researching new business ideas.
